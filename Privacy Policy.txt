1. Information We Collect
    PatoBot only collects the information necessary to function properly:

    Server data: Server ID, channel names, and roles required to execute commands.

    User data: User ID and username for features such as games, TTS, and music queue tracking.

    Command content: Messages sent to the bot to process AI, music, game, or TTS commands.

    No sensitive personal data (email, passwords, financial information) is collected, nor are other users' private messages accessed without their consent.

2. How We Use Information
    The collected information is used solely to:

    Manage the music queue and play songs.

    Facilitate interaction in games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

    Generate AI responses.

    Read text aloud using TTS.

    Improve the user experience and bot stability.

3. Data Storage and Security

    Data is temporarily stored in memory or local files on the server where the bot is running.

    No information is shared with third parties, except for necessary services such as music or AI APIs.

    Basic security measures are implemented to protect information against unauthorized access.

4. Use of External Services
    PatoBot may interact with external services such as:

    Music and lyrics APIs (e.g., YouTube, Lyrics.ovh).

    Text-to-speech services (gTTS).

    Artificial intelligence APIs (Gemini / Google Generative AI).

    These services may collect data to function properly. PatoBot does not control how these third parties use the information, and it is recommended to review their privacy policies.

5. Data Retention

    Information from music queues and game sessions is deleted when the bot restarts or when the session ends.

    Temporary audio files generated by TTS are automatically deleted after playback.

6. User Rights

    You can request the deletion of any stored information related to you (e.g., generated TTS files).

    You can disconnect the bot from your server at any time, which will delete the stored data related to that server.

7. Policy Changes
    We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. We recommend checking this page periodically to stay informed.

    If you have any questions about privacy or how PatoBot works, you can contact the developer via Discord "Robio2320" or the email address "PatoCreators@gmail.com".
